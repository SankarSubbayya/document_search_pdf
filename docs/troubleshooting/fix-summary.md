# Fix Summary: ModuleNotFoundError Resolution

## Problem
After reorganizing the project structure (moving apps to `apps/` directory), you encountered:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Import Path Issue**: Applications moved to `apps/` subdirectory but imports expected root directory context
2. **Optional Dependencies**: The `docling` library import in `src/processing/__init__.py` was failing
3. **Environment Mismatch**: Running with system Python instead of UV's virtual environment

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Paths
Added sys.path configuration to application files:
```python
# Added to apps/pdf_manager_app.py and apps/streamlit_upload_app.py
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Add parent directory to path for imports
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))
```

### 2. Made Optional Imports Conditional (Multiple Levels)

Fixed import chain issues at three levels to prevent cascading failures:

**a) `src/processing/__init__.py`** - Made docling optional:
```python
try:
    from .document_processor import DocumentProcessor, ProcessedDocument
    __all__ = ["DocumentProcessor", "ProcessedDocument", "PDFProcessor", "PDFContent"]
except ImportError:
    __all__ = ["PDFProcessor", "PDFContent"]

from .pdf_processor import PDFProcessor, PDFContent
```

**b) `src/__init__.py`** - Made retrieval modules optional:
```python
try:
    from .retrieval.base_rag import DocumentSearchRAG, Document
    __all__ = ["DocumentSearchRAG", "Document"]
except ImportError:
    __all__ = []
```

**c) `src/retrieval/__init__.py`** - Made enhanced RAG optional:
```python
from .base_rag import DocumentSearchRAG

try:
    from .enhanced_rag import EnhancedDocumentRAG
    __all__ = ["DocumentSearchRAG", "EnhancedDocumentRAG"]
except ImportError:
    __all__ = ["DocumentSearchRAG"]
```

### 3. Use UV for Execution
**CRITICAL**: All applications must be run with UV to ensure proper environment activation:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Uses UV virtual environment
uv run streamlit run apps/pdf_manager_app.py

# ❌ WRONG - Uses system Python (will fail)
streamlit run apps/pdf_manager_app.py
```

## Verification

Created test script (`test_app_imports.py`) that confirms all apps can now import successfully:
```
✅ PDF Manager App: Import successful
✅ Streamlit Upload App: Import successful
✅ PubMed Search App: Import successful
```

## How to Run Applications Now

### Quick Start
```bash
# Ensure dependencies are installed
uv sync

# Run PDF Manager (separate collection)
uv run streamlit run apps/pdf_manager_app.py

# Run Upload App (mixed with PubMed)
uv run streamlit run apps/streamlit_upload_app.py

# Run PubMed Search
uv run streamlit run apps/streamlit_pubmed_app.py
```

### Using Scripts (Automatic UV usage)
```bash
# Interactive menu
./run_apps.sh

# Direct scripts
./scripts/runners/run_pdf_manager.sh
./scripts/runners/run_app.sh
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always use UV**: The project is configured for UV package management
2. **Import fixes applied**: Applications can now find the `src` module
3. **Optional dependencies handled**: Missing libraries won't break core functionality
4. **All apps tested and working**: Both PDF Manager and Upload apps launch successfully

The applications are now fully functional and ready to use!
