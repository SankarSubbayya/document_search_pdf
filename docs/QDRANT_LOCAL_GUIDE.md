# Qdrant Local Mode Guide

## ✅ You're Already Using Local Mode!

Your code is configured to use Qdrant in **local/embedded mode**, which stores all vectors as files in the `qdrant_db/` directory. No server installation needed!

## 🎯 Two Ways to Use Qdrant

### **Option 1: Local Mode (Current Setup - Recommended for Development)**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No server to install or manage
- ✅ Data stored as files in your project
- ✅ Portable - copy `qdrant_db/` folder to move data
- ✅ Perfect for development and testing
- ✅ Works offline

**How it works:**
```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

# Local mode - stores in directory
client = QdrantClient(path="./qdrant_db")
```

**That's it!** This creates a file-based database in `./qdrant_db/`

---

### **Option 2: Server Mode (For Production)**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Better performance for large datasets
- ✅ Multiple clients can connect
- ✅ Web dashboard UI
- ✅ Advanced monitoring

**How it works:**
```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

# Server mode - connects to running Qdrant server
client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")
```

## 📦 Your Current Setup

### **1. Basic RAG System (document_search.py)**

```python
# Line 62-64
self.qdrant_client = QdrantClient(
    path=self.config.get("qdrant_path", "./qdrant_db")  # ← Local mode!
)
```

**Storage location:** `./qdrant_db/`
