## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. **Application Organization**
- ✅ Moved all Streamlit apps to `apps/` directory:
  - `pdf_manager_app.py` - Dedicated PDF management
  - `streamlit_pubmed_app.py` - PubMed search
  - `streamlit_upload_app.py` - Combined functionality

### 2. **Script Consolidation**
- ✅ Organized scripts into `scripts/` with subdirectories:
  - `runners/` - All run scripts and launchers
  - `utils/` - Utility and helper scripts
  - Main scripts remain in `scripts/`

### 3. **Documentation Cleanup**
- ✅ Moved all docs to `docs/` directory
- ✅ Archived duplicate READMEs to `docs/archive_readmes/`
- ✅ Created simplified main README
- ✅ Added PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md for clarity

### 4. **Configuration Management**
- ✅ Moved PDF-specific config to `config/` directory
- ✅ Main config.yaml remains in root (primary config)

### 5. **Cache and Temp Files**
- ✅ Removed all `__pycache__` directories
- ✅ Deleted `.pyc`, `.pyo` files
- ✅ Cleaned pytest cache
- ✅ Removed coverage files
- ✅ Deleted `.DS_Store` files

### 6. **Git Management**
- ✅ Created comprehensive `.gitignore`
- ✅ Excludes all cache, temp, and build files

## 🚀 How to Use the Clean Structure

### Running Applications

```bash
# Option 1: Use the menu launcher
./run_apps.sh

# Option 2: Direct execution
streamlit run apps/pdf_manager_app.py
streamlit run apps/streamlit_pubmed_app.py
streamlit run apps/streamlit_upload_app.py

# Option 3: Use specific runners
./scripts/runners/run_pdf_manager.sh
./scripts/runners/run_tests.sh
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# With UV (fastest)
uv run pytest tests/

# With script
./scripts/runners/test_with_uv.sh

# Traditional pytest
pytest tests/
```

### Starting Services

```bash
# Start Qdrant
./scripts/runners/start_qdrant.sh

# Or with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📊 Statistics

- **Files Organized**: 25+
- **Directories Created**: 5
- **Cache Files Removed**: All
- **Documentation Consolidated**: 15+ files
- **Scripts Organized**: 10+

## 🎯 Benefits of Clean Structure

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Easier Navigation**: Logical directory structure
3. **Reduced Clutter**: No duplicate or cache files
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear file locations
5. **Professional Structure**: Industry-standard layout

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test Applications**: Ensure all apps work from new locations
2. **Update Documentation**: Review and update any outdated docs
3. **Commit Changes**: Save the clean structure to git
4. **CI/CD Updates**: Update any CI/CD paths if needed

## 🔍 Quick Reference

| Component | Old Location | New Location |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| PDF Manager | `pdf_manager_app.py` | `apps/pdf_manager_app.py` |
| PubMed App | `app.py` | `apps/streamlit_pubmed_app.py` |
| Upload App | `app_with_upload.py` | `apps/streamlit_upload_app.py` |
| Run Scripts | Root directory | `scripts/runners/` |
| Test Scripts | Various | `scripts/utils/` |
| Documentation | Root + docs/ | `docs/` |
| Config Files | Root | `config/` (except main config.yaml) |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The main `config.yaml` remains in root as it's the primary configuration
- All import paths in Python files remain unchanged (using relative imports)
- Virtual environment (`.venv`) is untouched
- Qdrant data directories are preserved
