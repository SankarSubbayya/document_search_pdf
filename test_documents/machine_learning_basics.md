# Machine Learning Basics

## Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning. In this approach, the algorithm learns from labeled training data, where each example is paired with the correct output. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on these examples.

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

**Applications:**
- Email spam detection
- Credit card fraud detection
- Image classification
- Medical diagnosis

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data. The system tries to learn patterns and structures from the data without explicit instructions about what to predict.

**Common Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders

**Applications:**
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Data compression
- Feature extraction

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. The agent learns through trial and error.

**Key Concepts:**
- Agent and Environment
- States and Actions
- Rewards and Penalties
- Policy and Value Functions

**Applications:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go)
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Resource management

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Accuracy | Correct predictions / Total predictions | Classification |
| Precision | True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) | When false positives are costly |
| Recall | True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) | When false negatives are costly |
| F1 Score | Harmonic mean of precision and recall | Balanced measure |
| MSE | Mean Squared Error | Regression |
| MAE | Mean Absolute Error | Regression |
| RÂ² Score | Coefficient of determination | Regression |

## Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values
2. **Feature Scaling**: Normalization or standardization
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing ones
4. **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features
5. **Data Splitting**: Train/validation/test sets

## Best Practices

- Always start with simple models before moving to complex ones
- Use cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Monitor for overfitting and underfitting
- Keep track of experiments and results
- Document your preprocessing steps
- Consider computational resources and deployment constraints

## Conclusion

Machine learning is a powerful tool for solving complex problems. Success depends on understanding the problem domain, choosing appropriate algorithms, and properly preparing the data.
