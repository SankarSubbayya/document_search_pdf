# Deep Learning Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Neural Network Architecture

### Basic Components

1. **Neurons**: Basic computational units
2. **Layers**: Collections of neurons
   - Input Layer: Receives raw data
   - Hidden Layers: Process information
   - Output Layer: Produces predictions
3. **Weights and Biases**: Learnable parameters
4. **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity

### Common Activation Functions

| Function | Formula | Range | Use Case |
|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| ReLU | max(0, x) | [0, ∞) | Hidden layers |
| Sigmoid | 1/(1+e^-x) | (0, 1) | Binary classification |
| Tanh | (e^x - e^-x)/(e^x + e^-x) | (-1, 1) | Hidden layers |
| Softmax | e^xi / Σe^xj | (0, 1) | Multi-class output |
| Leaky ReLU | max(0.01x, x) | (-∞, ∞) | Avoiding dead neurons |
