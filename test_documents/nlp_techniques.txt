Natural Language Processing: Essential Techniques and Applications

1. TEXT PREPROCESSING FUNDAMENTALS
===================================

Text preprocessing is the foundation of any NLP pipeline. It involves cleaning and preparing raw text data for analysis.

Core Preprocessing Steps:
- Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words or subwords
- Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase for uniformity
- Removing punctuation: Eliminating non-essential characters
- Removing stop words: Filtering out common words like "the", "is", "at"
- Stemming: Reducing words to their root form (running → run)
- Lemmatization: Converting words to their dictionary form (better → good)

Advanced Preprocessing:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying persons, locations, organizations
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging: Labeling words as nouns, verbs, adjectives
- Dependency parsing: Understanding grammatical relationships
- Coreference resolution: Linking pronouns to their referents

2. TEXT REPRESENTATION METHODS
==============================

Traditional Methods:
- Bag of Words (BoW): Simple word frequency counts
- TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
- N-grams: Sequences of n consecutive words
- One-hot encoding: Binary vectors for each word

Modern Embeddings:
- Word2Vec: Neural network-based word embeddings
  * CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)
  * Skip-gram model
- GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation
- FastText: Subword-based embeddings

- BERT embeddings: Bidirectional contextualized embeddings

Sentence and Document Embeddings:
- Doc2Vec: Extension of Word2Vec for documents
